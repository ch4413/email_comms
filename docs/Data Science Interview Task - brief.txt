
Summary of Study
====================

A study was conducted to examine the effect of e-mail communications over time.

An experiment was constructed to determine whether the effect of a particular type of
e-mail send would improve e-mail open rates.

Each person in the study received 10 e-mail communications over the course of a
month. The experiment was constructed in order to determine whether an incentive
structure could improve open rates. In the experimental condition, the authors
had increased the reward structure each time that an e-mail was sent (regardless 
of whether the e-mail was opened). Therefore, we hypothesize that there 
would be an increase in open rates at each e-mail send. The control group did 
not receive a reward.


Goals: 
       1: Build a model that best explains likelihood to open.  
       2: Test the hypothesis that for each e-mail send for the experimental group,
          there should be an increase in e-mail opens.
